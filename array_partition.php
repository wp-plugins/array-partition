Plugin Name: array_partition
Version: 1.0.1
Plugin URI: http://coffee2code.com/wp-plugins/array_partition
Author: Scott Reilly
Author URI: http://coffee2code.com
Description: Introduces function array_partition() to split an array into N number of evenly distributed partitions (useful for splitting a list into columns).

This plugin provides a PHP function to split an array into any number of sub-arrays, suitable for creating evenly
distributed (vertically filled) "columns".  Also known as "chunking" or "partitioning".

For example:

$topics = array( "ant", "bear", "cat", "dog", "emu", "frog", "gnu", "hippo", "ibis", "jackal");
print_r(array_partition($topics, 4));

Yields:

Array
(
    [0] => Array
        (
            [0] => ant
            [1] => bear
            [2] => cat
        )

    [1] => Array
        (
            [0] => dog
            [1] => emu
            [2] => frog
        )

    [2] => Array
        (
            [0] => gnu
            [1] => hippo
        )

    [3] => Array
        (
            [0] => ibis
            [1] => jackal
        )

)

The function will fill as many partitions as requested, as long as there are enough elements in the array to do so.  Any
remaining unfilled partitions will be represented as empty arrays.

Why not use PHP's built-in array_chunk()?  array_chunk() allows you to specify the number of elements per partition,
not how many partitions you want.

It can be sent an array of any data types or objects.

Compatible with all versions of WordPress.
